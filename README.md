# zalgify
Text to zalgo converter. 

## Zalgo? What's that?
[Zalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character#Zalgo_text) is a method of text corruption by putting lots of combining diacritics on characters to achieve a kind of eldritch, higher-power-like aesthetic. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454) for the perhaps most famous example of zalgo.

## Building the program
Assuming you have a reasonably recent version of [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed, simply run `stack build` and you should be good to go.

## Using the program
_Coming soon._

## Can I use this?
Yes! As long as you abide by the terms of the MIT license, you're free to do with this whatever you want. I'm also happy if you have improvements you want to send upstream.
